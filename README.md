# TextReplacer
I mainly created this cuz I needed to replace some text in a lot of files and I don't wanna go on each file,
search the occurrence and replace it, with this tool that job will be a piece of cake!

# Usage
Copy the following command
```sh
java -jar TextReplacer.jar "{VARIABLE TO SEARCH FOR}" "{VARIABLE TO REPLACE IT WITH}" "{FILE/DIRECTORY PATH}"
```
